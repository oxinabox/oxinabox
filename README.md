# üêÇ Hi Hi, I am Lyndon
Feel encouraged to reach out to me. I like people.\
I am very contactable online. I am sure you can find me.\



GitHub doesn't make it easy to showcase all the projects I am involved in.
Especially with so many being inside various github orgs.
So I am using this profile README.md to experiment with providing something better



Below you will find a list of projects I am involved in, that I think are particularly cool.
*Note that it is incomplete, and this is currently an experiment.*
